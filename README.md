# WaterQualityPrediction_AICTE
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques specifically 'MultiOutputRegressor ' wrapped around a 'RandomForestRegressor '. It was developed as a part of a one-month **AICTE virtual internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025**.

## Overview 
Access to clean water is critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.
In this project we:
- Collected and preprocessed real water quality datesets.
- Used supervised machine learning for mukti target regressionb.
- Built a pipeline using 'MultiOutputRegressor' with 'RandomForestRegressor'.
- Evaluate the model using appropriate regression metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas, NumPy**- Data handling
- **Scikit-learn**- Machine learning model and evaluation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**- Data visualization
- **Jupyter notebook**- Interactive experimentation

---

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters 

The model predicts multiple water quality such as:
- NH4
- BOD5(BSK5)
- Colloids
- O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and
- CL

---

## Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:
- **RÂ² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error**

Performance was acceptable across all parameters
